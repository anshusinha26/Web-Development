        <h2>What is a domestic dog?</h2>
        <p>
            The term “domestic dog” refers to any of several hundred breeds of
            dog in the world today. While these animals vary drastically in
            appearance, every dog—from the Chihuahua to the Great Dane—is a
            member of the same species, <i><b>Canis familiaris</b></i
            >. This separates domestic dogs from wild <b>canines</b>, such as
            coyotes, foxes, and wolves. Domestic dogs are mostly kept as pets,
            though many breeds are capable of surviving on their own, whether
            it’s in a forest or on city streets. A third of all households
            worldwide have a dog, according to a 2016 consumer insights study.
            This makes the domestic dog the most popular pet on the planet.

        <h2>Evolutionary origins</h2>
        <p>
            All dogs descend from a species of wolf, but not the gray wolf
            (Canis lupus), like many people assume. In fact,

            evidence suggests that the now-extinct wolf ancestor to modern dogs
            was Eurasian. However, scientists are still working to understand
            exactly what species gave rise to dogs. When dogs broke off from
            their wild ancestors is also a matter of mystery, but genetics
            suggest that it occurred between 15,000 and 30,000 years ago. While
            it’s impossible to say exactly how a wild wolf species became a
            domesticated dog, most scientists believe the process happened
            gradually as wolves became more comfortable with humans. Perhaps
            wolves started down this path simply by eating human scraps. Many
            generations later, humans might have encouraged wolves to stay near
            by actively feeding them. Later still, those wolves may have been
            welcomed into the human home and eventually bred to encourage
            certain traits. All of this is thought to have unfolded over
            thousands of years.
