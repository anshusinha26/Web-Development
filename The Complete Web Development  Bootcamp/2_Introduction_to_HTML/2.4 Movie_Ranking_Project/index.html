        <h3>Interstellar</h3>
        <p>
            "Interstellar" is a thought-provoking science fiction film directed
            by Christopher Nolan. Set in a near-future Earth on the brink of
            collapse, it follows a group of astronauts who journey through a
            wormhole near Saturn in search of a new habitable planet for
            humanity. Led by Matthew McConaughey's character, they face
            mind-bending challenges involving time dilation and the mysteries of
            space as they seek to secure humanity's future. The film explores
            themes of love, sacrifice, and the resilience of the human spirit
            against the backdrop of cosmic exploration.
